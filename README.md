# ðŸ§  House Price Prediction â€“ My First ML Project

This project uses machine learning to predict house sale prices using real housing data.

## ðŸ›  What I Did

- Cleaned messy data (handled missing values)
- Selected features like house size, quality, and garage capacity
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated performance using Mean Absolute Error
- Visualized predictions with a scatter plot (actual vs predicted)

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## âœ… What I Learned

- How to prepare real-world data for modeling
- How machine learning models are trained and tested
- How to evaluate prediction results and explain them clearly

This is part of my journey to become a data scientist. More projects coming soon!
